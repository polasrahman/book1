        <p>This is a page about Dianetics, the most popular book ever written on the human mind.  It’s been translated in to 50 languages, been on many best seller lists including the New York Times, and has been turned into a documentary.  Hundreds of thousands of successful people all around the world have read and used it and the book continues to be sell each year.</p>
        <p>Why would people be so interested in a book about the mind?  Well, it’s not a technical volume written for specialists.  It’s a book about you, your mind and your personal well being and potential.  In the first chapter alone, it explains why each one of us only uses 10% of our potential.</p>
        <p>Then it tells you where that other 90% is and <b>how to develop it.</b></p></p>
        <p>Then there’s more:</p>
        <p  class="clear"></p>
        <p><blockquote><b>Have you ever heard the expression that someone’s illness was “all in the mind”?  If that was true, why wouldn’t the person just decide to get better and the illness would go away?</b></blockquote></p>
        <p  class="clear"></p>
        <img src="img/mental-health.jpg" class="related-image related-image-right"/>
        <p>It’s long been known that there are “psychosomatic illnesses”, illnesses which are caused by the mind.  By some estimates, they can account for as much as 70% of illnesses and may include things like nervous stomachs, ulcers, headaches, migraines, allergies, asthma, panic attacks, anorexia, arthritis, and more.</p>
        <p>There are many accounts of people getting well, perhaps suddenly, simply by deciding that they were going to  so.  (And others where people just gave up hope and deteriorated for no physical reason.)  Actually, the placebo effect is a proven fact: 20% of people get well when given a fake pill which they believe is real.</p>
        <p>The problem with this is, it’s not very controllable or repeatable.  Otherwise, doctors would use it constantly and we would all save money on medicine.</p>
        <p>An entire chapter of Dianetics is dedicated to the source of these illnesses, and how to find and handle them.  This is real, repeatable technology you can use.</p>
        <p>In short, this is a book based on real life experiments and trials which shows a person how to unlock hidden talents and improve their lives.</p>
        <p><blockquote><b>Everyone has some aspect of their life they’d like to improve.  If you had to pick one from your own life, what would you choose?</b></blockquote></p>
        <p  class="clear"></p>
        <img src="img/improve.jpg" class="related-image related-image-left"/>
        <p>Go on.  We’d like to ask you to go ahead and name it.</p>
        <p>For example, are you sometimes inexplicably anxious, nervous, impulsive, insecure, shy, or moody?  Do you think too much or feel sad without a valid reason?</p>
        <p>Pick the thing you’d most like to change.</p>
        <p>Now, honestly, do you want to be like this?  If you don’t, then why are you exactly?  Why are you doing it?</p>
        <p><b>Now for the bad news</b></p>
        <p>Unfortunately there’s some bad news and it’s this: if you don’t do something about this situation, it’s going to get worse.  Just keeping on going in life, doing what you’re doing, won’t address it.  And if you don’t address it, well neglected things deteriorate, don’t they? Your lack of attention will be enough to worsen it.</p>
        <p>But if you know what’s going on, there is some chance that you can put yourself in control and improve it.  And that’s what this book is here to help you with.</p>
        <p>It will tell you what lies behind your situation.    Then, it gives you the precise steps you can take to handle it so that it won’t bother you again.</p>
        <p><b>By the way, how old are you?</b></p>
        <p  class="clear"></p>
        <img src="img/you.jpg" class="related-image related-image-right"/>
        <p>Obviously that’s a personal question and of course, you don’t really have to answer it.  However it’s worth asking, because reading this book would be the first time in that many years that you would actually be doing something to really care of yourself.</p>
        <p>You’ve never done this before!</p>
        <p>We’re not referring to your body here, we’re talking about YOU! You can brush your teeth, shave, take care of your body, etc, but we are talking here about <b>taking care</b> in the fullest sense of the word.  Taking care of your character, your personality, your life, YOU! You are very important, more so than you would ever believe!</p>
        <p><blockquote><b>As we mentioned in the beginning, hundreds of thousands of successful people all around the world have read and used Dianetics.  Why?</b></blockquote></p>
        <p>They use Dianetics because it works. Because it is not just one of the many books that only give theories.  Dianetics gives theory and practice.  Factually it contains techniques you can go ahead and use, straight out of the book.</p>
        <p>Dianetics is available now on Amazon.  This is your chance.  Good luck and we look forward to hearing how you get on.</p>
